# modified projection method
# Examples in Nagurney A, 2006. Supply Chain Network Economics (Chapter 2) 

# created in Python 2.7
# varfunc_st.py: set up of variables and functions
# starting.py: contains starting values, epsilon and max number of iterations
# varfunc_eg files: examples 2.1 - 2.8
# run.py: run (modified projection method; as stated in the chapter)
# run2.py: run( Euler method (?))
#####
# To Run: (how)
# Change the name of the example file you want to run in the import line of varfunc_st.py and run.py.
# Change the starting values and epsilon.
# Change the example file (varfunc_eg#.py) if necessary; change number of manufacturers, retailers, markets, and the functions (production, cost and demand).
# Run the run2.py or run.py.
